###Challenge 13 Temperature-converter-website

Temperature converter website


Introduction


You'll create a simple app to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and vice-versa. This project should be implemented as a Single Page Application using React.

Requirements


The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit.

Your UI should include four main elements:

Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input is a number!
Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit
"Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion
Display area for the final converted temperature and unit
For an extra challenge: You can add in a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin as well.

###Bibliografy 

It was very interesing learn about Usestate in React . In this case we had to investigated about this concept, work with Javascript, and use our intelligence to go with this challenge. Here is the documentation for this topic:

###What I  learned ?

I did not have knowlege about the different React's functionalities mixing Javascript. Here you will find the solution of this challenge
